This package includes dppdaemon which aims to imitate DPP roles on behalf
of host and automates the process from DPP authentication to prvisioning
and finally connection.

Usage:
Command line options
--------------------

  -i / --interface         Interface on which wpa supplicant is running.

  -c / --client_path <dir> wpa supplicant client path.

  -n / --netrole           network role of the host.

  -p / --prov_role         Provision role of the host.

  -a / --auth_role         Authentication role of the host.

  -x / --xml_file <file>   Xml file path

  -l / --log_dir <dir>     Logging directory path (Optional arg)
    NOTE: If this option is specified, the log level would be DEBUG otherwise INFO.

  -h / --help              Help Menu

For eg. dppdaemon -i wlan0 -c /var/run/wpa_supplicant -n sta -p enrollee
        -a responder -x default.xml
The above commands would first parse default.xml file and get the bootstrap
parameters and sets up a URI. Now it will put host supplicant in DPP_LISTEN
mode (Responder) and where it will Authenticate with peer device (Initiator).
Once Authentication handshake is done, it follows Dpp configuration handshake
with Peer to read network profile and along with trigger connection with the
received network profile.

NOTE: Make sure xml file is readable to the user forking dppdaemon process.

Dpp Manager Library
--------------------
This package also includes the dpp manager shared ibrary which exposes an api
named ProcessCommand(cmd) where cmd is C++ string object and takes the argument
as the command mentioned above.
For eg. cmd :=  -i wlan0 -c /var/run/wpa_supplicant -n sta -p enrollee -a responder
                -x default.xml -l /tmp
